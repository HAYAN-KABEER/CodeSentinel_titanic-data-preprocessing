“Data Analysis – Titanic Dataset preprocessing with Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.”
# Titanic Dataset – Data Preprocessing (Task 2)

This repository contains my work for **Internship Task 2**  focusing on data preprocessing for the Titanic dataset.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python** 🐍  
- **Pandas** 🐼 – for data manipulation and cleaning  
- **NumPy** 🔢 – for numerical operations  
- **Scikit-learn** 🔧 – for preprocessing techniques (One-Hot Encoding & Label Encoding)  

---

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the **Titanic Dataset**

---

## ✅ Tasks Performed
1. Handling missing values 🧹  
2. One-Hot Encoding 🔢 for categorical features  
3. Label Encoding 🎯 for categorical features  
4. Preparing the dataset for data analysis and machine learning  

---

## 📈 Outcome
- Cleaned and preprocessed dataset ready for machine learning models  
- Gained hands-on experience in **data cleaning**, **feature engineering**, and **data preprocessing**
